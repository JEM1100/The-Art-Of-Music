# Roadmap

The following features are planned for this project:

1. Song Match: compare a song with other entries in the database and find the best match in terms of BPM, key and chords.
2. Compatibility View: a table view for each entry showing a list of songs which are compatible (i.e. can be mixed well) with that entry. 

Just let me know if you have any other ideas for useful features!
