# theArtOfMusic

A little Webpage that displays a data table with various information about songs. It allows users to add, edit and delete database records and filter songs by name, BPM, key and chords. 

How to get started:
1. Make sure you have the following programms installed:
    XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
    MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)

2. Copy or clone this github repository in the htdocs folder of XAMPP. On Windows machines, this folder can usually be found under "C:\xampp\htdocs". 
3. Open the XAMPP Control Panel . Set up the local test server by starting the Apache and MySQl module. 
4. Create a MySQL Database with the name "the_art_of_music" (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-new-database-in-phpmyadmin/). Make sure to spell the database name correctly, otherwise the PHP script won't work)
5. Populate the Database with the test data from the github repository "00_mysql_test_data.sql" (https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395768-phpMyAdmin-How-to-import-a-database-or-table). 
6. Open your web broswer, go to "localhost". Click on the link "theArtOfMusic".
7. That's it. You should now be able to add, edit and delete your own database records.
